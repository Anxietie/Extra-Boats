# Extra Boats

1.20.1 mod that adds crimson and warped boat variants to the game.

## Dependencies
- Fabric API

## Compatibility
This mod SHOULD be compatible with just about everything. However, I've done no testing.

## DISCLAIMER
v2.0 adds the ability for the boats to be ridden on lava AND removes their ability to be ridden on water
SO, get v1.1 if you just want the new boats to have vanilla functionality. OR, get v2 for the modified functionality.
